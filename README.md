# arctools
Tool that helps making fanmade charts in Arcade.

## Running
This tool is based on `tkinter` to provide GUI.  
Make sure you ticked `tcl/tk and IDLE` when installing Python on Windows.  
After Python installation, run `arctools.py` script.

## Split arc
Paste `arc(..);` expression(s) into input textbox and press convert.

## Eased timings
Currently there are 8 easings, `s`, `b`, `si`, `so`, `qi`, `qo`, `ci`, `co`.  
You should be very familiar with first four easings, for latter easings,  
`qi` and `qo` is quadratic, `ci` `co` is cubic and that's it.
